# Prerequisites

## Device
- Bring your own laptop

## Application
- Built-in Command Line Interface (Linux / MacOS) or 'terminal'
- GitBash (Windows) - download [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Your favorite text editor such as nano/vim/Notepad++/etc. For reference, the hands-on will be using `vim`.

## Test your environment
1. Open your terminal or open GitBash
2. Open your text editor using their command, e.g.
    - Vim: `$ vim`
    - Nano: `$ nano`
3. Open another terminal/GitBash session, make sure you can run these commands:
    - `$ grep`
    - `$ sed`
    - `$ awk`

If something like this turns up:

```shell
$ awk
bash: awk: command not found
```
it means your environment is missing that command. Troubleshoot and test again.
