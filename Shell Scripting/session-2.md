# Our first scripts of the day

## welcome.sh
- shebang `!#/bin/bash` <br>
it is used to specify which shell interpreter to be used.
- comment `# this is a comment`<br>
anything after a '#' will not be run as a command.
- echo<br>
we call this command to display output on the terminal, just like the one we used before.
- date<br>
this command is used to retrieve current system's date and time

## welcome-edit.sh

- copy the welcome.sh into a new file called `welcome-edit.sh`
- modify the new file so the output is similar to this (5 minutes)<br>
